    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this homework, I worked on simulating clothing movement using a simple mass and spring system and this was split up into five main components 
      which I will briefly touch on here. The five components included:
      <ol>
        <li>
          First creating the grid of mass and spring systems while making sure we account for bending, shearing, and structural contraints.
        </li>
        <li>
          The second part included integrating the physical equations of motion that would then allow us to apply forces onto our cloth's 
          mass point to simulate movement between time steps. 
        </li>
        <li>
          The third step in this process included taking into account collisions between the cloth and any other objects that may be present 
          in the scene
        </li>
        <li>
          The fourth step included integrating self collisions to account for the case where the cloth may collapse and "fall" onto the plane 
          thus allowing it to fold onto itself rather than clipping straight through the plane
        </li>
        <li>
          Lastly I implemented a few basic GLSL shader programs that would allow us to sections of the graphic pipeline on the GPU rather 
          than the CPU
        </li>
        All of the above steps would come together and allow for a comprehensive project that allows for cloth movement simulation using a simple
        mass and springs system as its foundation.
      </ol>

  <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
  </a>
  <h3> Implementation overview</h3>
  <p>
  For my implementation, I personally found the spec to be extremely helpful and modeled my code off that. I first began by 
  creating all the point masses on the grid and for that, I followed a simple double for loop approach and made sure 
  to space apart my masses evenly. I also had to take into account whether we were in a "horizontal" or "vertical" orientation 
  and made sure to make the correct Vector3D position object instance based off this. Lastly, it was during this first portion 
  where I also iterated through the pinned masses to identify whether the newly created point mass should be pinned or not and I 
  made sure to update this field member appropriately as well. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Once I got done with instantiating the grid with all the point masses, I moved on to the second part of my implementation which included 
  creating all the structural, shearing, and bending constraints as outlined in the spec. It was a bit hard to visualize how this 
  would be coded up so I first decided to draw up some diagrams/visuals on my tablet to identify potential edge cases to consider for each 
  of the three constraints. Once I developed a solid idea for all the cases I had to consider, then I went through and coded up my 
  implementation. My implementation followed a very similar structure to the previous part where I made a double for loop to iterate 
  through all the point masses in the grid and for every point, I made sure to include any of the structural, shearing, and bending 
  constraints as needed.

    <p>
      I messed around with a variety of values for the spring constant, ks, including 50, 500, 5000, 50000, and lastly 75000. Anything 
      beyond a value of 75000 resulted in the simulation acting erratically and the cloth going outside of the depicted scene. The default 
      spring constant value, ks, was designated to be 5000 and this resulted in the original default cloth. As the k value decreased, 
      in my case to values of 50 and 500, I noticed that the cloth became more "bendable" and "foldable" and this effect was very apparent in the 
      images below. On the other hand, as the k value increased, the cloth became more "sturdy" and "rigid-like."

      Similar to the spring constant, I also tried a variety of values for the density. In my case, this included testing 
      3.75, 7.5, 15, 30, and 60. Based on the images below, I noticed that as I increased the value of the density, 
      the cloth, once again, become more "bendable" and "foldable", whereas for smaller density values, the "bending" 
      and "folding" effect was more reduced.

    <p>
      For damping, I also tried testing a variety of values, in this case: 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.40, and 0.80. The effects of meddling 
      around with the damping value is not as easy to identify in the images below, however, the effect is very much present 
      in the simulation when you change the damping value. For values smaller than the default value of 0.20, the simulation seemed to 
      take a lot longer to converge and come to rest and the cloth seemed to be oscillating back and forth several times before 
      ultimately stopping. For values larger than the default value of 0.20, the similation of the cloth converged a lot quicker to rest 
      and there was very little to no apparent oscillations present: the cloth seemed to converge to rest as soon as the simulation began.

  <a href="https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/sp23/docs/proj4-part-3">
  <h2 align="middle">Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
  </a>
  <h3> Implementation overview</h3>
  <p>
    To handle collisions with spheres, I first extracted two key pieces of information given our point: the last position and the 
    current position. Using these two pieces of information, I then calculated the Euclidean distance from the current position 
    to the center of the sphere and then I tested to see whether this distance was smaller or equal to our radius and if this condition 
    was true, then we knew that the point at the current time stamp was indeed inside or on the surface of the sphere. If this was the case, 
    then I got the surface intersection vector by retrieving the point originating from the center of the sphere to the radius 
    along the direction of the current point position. I then got the correction vector by subtracting the last position of our point 
    from this surface intersection and I applied the correction as needed, scaled down by the friction as outlined on the spec.
    <br>
    <br>
    To handle collisions with planes, I once again extracted the last position and the current position of our point. Next I used the 
    plane equation to calculate the offsets from our plane given both the last and current position. Given these two offsets, I 
    then multiplied them together and the logic here was the following:
    <ul>
        <li>
            If the sign of the multiplication was a positive, then that means that the point has not crossed over to the other side of the plane
            from the previous timestep to the current timestep
        </li>
        <li>
            If the sign of the multiplication was negative, then this means that the point has crossed this "boundary" and has gone 
            over to the other side of the plane, and this was the case that we were particularly interested in. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    So, if the sign of the multiplication was negative, then I proceeded by following the "ray intersection with plane" approach 
    and calculating what t is given the point on the plane, the last and current positions of the point passed in, 
    and the normal vector of the plane. I then calculated the intersection by getting the last position of the point and multiplying 
    it by this t value along the direction in which the given point was travelling. Using this information, I then computed the 
    correction vector and, making sure to account for the displacement above the intersection, and applied the correction as needed, 
    scaled down by the friction as outlined in the spec.

    <p>
      The above images depict the simulation of the cloth falling on top of a sphere with different spring constant, ks, values. In this 
      case, the values tested were 500, 5000, and 50000. Based on the above simulations and corresponding iamges, it seems like 
      the smaller the spring constant value is, the more the cloth seems to "fold over" the sphere, whereas for greater spring constant 
      values, the cloth does not seem to "fold over" as much and instead lays on top of the sphere with a more "flat-like" appearance.

    <p>
      For the spring constant, ks, I tried testing out different values. In my case, those values included 1000, 5000 (default value), and 75000.
      One thing I noticed based on the above photos was that when my spring constant value was 1000, there seemed to be a lot of "smaller" folds present 
      in the cloth at the time of it making contact with the plane and this ultimately led to a lot of rough folds that were never able to fully 
      smoothen out. On the contrary, when my spring constant value was 7500, the size of the folds present in the cloth at the time 
      of it making contact with the plane were "bigger" and many of these folds were resolved and led to the cloth looking a lot more flattened and smoothened out 
      on top of the plane. Based on the above results, then the conclusion can be made that lesser spring constant values lead to a lot of rough and uneven 
      folds that never fully unfold whereas greater spring constant values have "bigger" folds and leads to the cloth being a lot more flattened 
      out on top of the plane.
      <br>
      <br>
      For density, the values I tried out included 1, 15 (default value), and 50. One thing I noticed, and that can be seen in the images above, is 
      that when my density value was 1, there seemed to be a lot of less, but "bigger" folds present at the time that the cloth first made contact with the plane 
      and this ultimately led to the cloth being far more smoother and flattened on top of the plane. On the other hand, when my density value was 50, 
      there were a lot more "smaller" folds present in the cloth at the time of it making contact with the plane and this ultimately led to a lot of rough and 
      uneven folds that were never fully resolved and this is clearly seen in the images above. Based on the above results, the conclusion can be made 
      that this works inversely to the spring constant value where a lesser density value leads to less rougher folds and leads to the cloth being a lot more smooth 
      and flattened out whereas greater density values leads to rough and uneven folds that never fully unfold.

    Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      A shader program is a program that allows us to run parallel in the GPU and execute sections of the graphics pipeline. This is far better 
      than what we were doing previously, where all of the raytracing computation was taking place on the CPU and thus took up a large amount of 
      time to render. In our case, we wrote some basic GLSL shader programs and we primarily dealt with two basic OpenGL shader types...vertex shaders 
      and fragment shaders. 
      <ul>
        <li>
          Vertex shaders allows us to apply transformations and modify geometric properties that are then used by the fragment shader.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fragment shaders allow us to take the geometric attributes that are computed and modified from the vertex shaders to compute 
          a final color and/or material for any and all fragments after rasterization has taken place.
        </li>
      </ul> 
      So in essence, vertex shaders allow us to modify existing geometric properties of fragements that are then used by fragment shaders to 
      generate a final color and or texture material.

    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      The Blinn-Phong shading model is a model that allows us to simulate how lights interact with surfaces and in our case the 3 types of lighting we are 
      concerned with include: Ambient Lighting, Diffuse Lighting, and Specular Lighting. 
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ambient lighting assumes that constant lighting is applied to all parts of the scene equally and as such, is reflected equally off all 
          objects and surfaces that may be present in the scene.
        </li>
        <li>
          Diffuse lighting assumes that now the intensity of the light at a given position on the surface depends on the direction of the normal vector 
          of the surface point relative to the light source. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Specular lighting assumes that when light interacts/intersects with a surface that it then bounces off in a specific direction. 
          The intensity of the light hitting the surface is still dependent on the normal vector of the surface point relative to the light source. 
          However, now we also take into consideration the angle between the viewer and the direction in which the light bounces off. The specular component 
          also allows us to make objects/surfaces appear glossy and shiny as well. 
        </li>
      </ul>

    <p>
      Based on the above images, we can analyze and see that for the 16x16 case, it seems like bump mapping performs better overall 
      and this is evident as the 16x16 case for displacement mapping has some abnormal deformities as a result of the texture present on the sphere. 
      However, when it comes to the 128x128 case, it definitely looks as if displacement mapping performs better as it is able to 
      encapsulate much more of the texture that is present on the sphere while at the same time also displaying an accurate portrayal of 
      the lighting present.
